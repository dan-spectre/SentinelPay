## 📄 International Journal Publication

**SentinelPay: A Hybrid AI-Driven System for Real-Time Fraud Detection in Digital Payment Systems**  
Published in **International Journal for Research in Advanced Computer Science and Engineering (IJRACSE)**  
**Volume 12 • Issue 1 • May 2026**

This project has been officially validated and published as an international research article for its hybrid AI-assisted digital payment fraud detection architecture.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**SentinelPay** is a production-grade event-driven fintech fraud prevention platform that analyses every UPI payment transaction through a **3-stage intelligent fraud verdict engine before transaction authorization**.

The platform combines:

- deterministic rule evaluation,
- Redis-backed behavioural anomaly tracking,
- Spring AI contextual reasoning,
- Kafka asynchronous event orchestration,
- and real-time user notification workflows

to deliver a scalable fraud detection ecosystem built for modern digital payments.

## 📊 Published Benchmark Results

| Metric | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| Detection Accuracy | **95.2%** |
| Precision | **93.8%** |
| Recall | **94.6%** |
| F1 Score | **94.2%** |
| Average Processing Latency | **~50 ms** |
| Throughput | **1200 TPS** |

These measured results were obtained from a 50,000 transaction fraud simulation benchmark with real-time event-driven orchestration.

---

## 🧠 Why SentinelPay Matters

UPI fraud and digital payment anomalies continue to grow rapidly while most traditional systems still rely on:

- post-payment fraud checks,
- brittle static thresholds,
- delayed manual intervention.

SentinelPay solves this by ensuring:

✅ fraud analysis before money moves  
✅ millisecond-level verdict generation  
✅ scalable asynchronous transaction processing  
✅ AI-assisted contextual anomaly identification  
✅ full observability with production monitoring

## ⚡ 3-Layer Fraud Detection Pipeline

| Layer | Engine | Speed | Fraud Coverage |
|-------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Layer 1 | Rule Engine | <1 ms | amount spikes, location mismatch, transaction velocity |
| Layer 2 | Redis Behavioural Engine | <5 ms | impossible travel, device switching, repeated suspicious patterns |
| Layer 3 | Spring AI Contextual Analysis | adaptive | unseen anomalies, semantic behavioural irregularities |

Each fraud layer short-circuits on a `FRAUD` verdict to minimize latency while preserving high-confidence AI analysis for borderline transactions.

## 🏗️ Distributed Microservice Architecture

<img width="2162" height="4520" alt="microservice-architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ae901d0-1fa5-40fa-8d3c-c6c297f6d9e3" />

### Core Services

- **API Gateway** → centralized JWT validation and request routing
- **Auth Service** → user registration, login, token issuance
- **Transaction Service** → UPI payment intake and Kafka event publishing
- **Fraud Detection Service** → hybrid fraud scoring engine
- **Bank Service** → account balance management and UPI simulation
- **Notification Service** → asynchronous fraud alert dispatch
- **React Frontend** → customer-facing dashboard

Kafka acts as the event backbone while Redis enables sub-millisecond behavioural profile access.
